Simple client, that triggers TCP stream broke bug.

Run it against cam. 
Whel sleep() executed, TCP receive window get overloaded, and TCP stream put on pause.
On server (camera) side, at that point one of send() system call on stream returns less bytes sent, that was requested.

Correct (expected) behaviour:
  - some of stream must be buffered on camera side (as much, as free RAM available)
  - once camera get out of free RAM for buffering -- TCP connection MUST be dropped

Actual behaviour:
  - non-sent data lost (result of send() call are ignored)
  as result -- stream get broken.
